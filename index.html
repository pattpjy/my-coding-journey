After a decade in finance and audit, I pursued my dream of owning a catering business. Although it shut down in 2020, the experience ignited my passion for leveraging technology to overcome challenges faced by small businesses. As a software engineer, I strive to develop innovative solutions that empower small businesses to achieve success in a competitive market.

          <br />
          In my next role, I seek to be part of an autonomous team built on trust, where open communication and constructive feedback are valued. A collaborative and supportive environment that fosters creativity and drives continuous improvement. Working alongside talented individuals who share a common goal is essential to me. I am particularly interested in joining companies in the food tech or education tech industries, as I highly value their potential to create value and enhance performance for small businesses.
