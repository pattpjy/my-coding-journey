Beginner guide to interactive CSS and animation.

Static website is easy to make. With a simple CSS styling and a little interactive elements can go a long way. Follow along as I show a couple easy css properties and effects that can add a lot visual impact to your site.

Some basic HTML interactive element

- Button `<button></button>`
  <button>I'm a button</button>
- input field `<input type='text'><input>`
  <input type='text'>
- select element with number of options element `<select><option></option></select>`
<select Name="Choose Me"><option>option 1</option><option>option 2</option>
<option>option 3</option>
</select>

two ways of making the interactive element do things

- directly add style property to html attribute
- using javascript

Hover effect on a button
Hover effect on a div
Hover effect on a span

<button class="btn-hover">HOVER Effect</button>

Active property on a button - tell user that button is clickable

The best styling is when it's talk back to you visually
