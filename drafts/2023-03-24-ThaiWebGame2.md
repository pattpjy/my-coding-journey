#### Task 1 writing out user story for the red box MVP

![Breaking down work](../asset/ThWorkBreakDown.png)

These are first iteration users story - red box
**As a user -**

1. when I visit the site, I can see the game description and hear the greeting message
2. I can start the game from landing page
3. when the game start, I can click image tiles and it will play the name of the image in Thai.

In order to deliver value quickly, I want to create the backend which include the server and the database. The data at this point would be a fairly simple, a voice record associate to the a few words. I can achieved that with a single table in a database. From there, spin up an API and server should be straightforward. I want to use PARN stack for this project because I want stay with 1 language and JSON structure. My voice record will be store in google drive for now.

### does it work the way I plan, struggle and challenge?
