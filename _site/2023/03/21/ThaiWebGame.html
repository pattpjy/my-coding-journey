  <h1>Code In Public - Thai Word Game</h1>
  <h1 id="thai-word-game-phase-i">Thai Word Game Phase I</h1>

<p>My first language is Thai, and I want to create a simple webapp word game to play with my four years old. I watched my daughter played with a stuffed animal that when she press a button, it’d say random words and she’d keep repeating them over and over. I though it would be fun to create a similar UI web application that my daughter can simply press a button tha play words in Thai that she can repeat.</p>

<p><img src="../../../asset/ThInitWireFrame.png" alt="UI-WireFrame IMG" /></p>

<p>Because it will be for a small child, the image and buttons would be fairly large. The layout will be simple with minimal color contrast and easy to understand images.</p>

<h4 id="task-2-breaking-work-down--color-blocks">Task 2 Breaking work down : color blocks</h4>

<p>I am very excited to see this app in action that led me to breaking task down in the way that I can deliver value quickly. For the app to be able to have the most basic function, I need to create the component in the red area first. The red box include the UI components and the backend server with single table to support the minimum required data.<br />

<p>The next step is to write user story, creating React architecture and backend server and database. My intend is to build this application in public. Stay tune for more post!</p>

<p>“This is a my new idea for an app that I intent to build in public, It’s an app to help my 3 year old learn Thai! follow along as I build it!</p>
