You know what’s cool? Empathy mapping. And guess what? It’s not just for UX designers—it’s also a game-changer for UI developers like you. Let me tell you why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>User-Centered Design</strong> : Empathy mapping helps you design interfaces that users will adore. By understanding their needs, frustrations, and goals, you can create UIs that make their hearts skip a beat. Who doesn’t want users to fall head over heels for their UI?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design Decision Making</strong> : Empathy mapping gives you the power to make smart design decisions. By diving into users’ minds and behaviors, you can prioritize features, organize elements, and choose the right interactions. It’s like having a crystal ball that shows you exactly what users want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration and Communication</strong> : Empathy mapping is often a collaborative process. And as a UI developer, knowing the ins and outs of empathy mapping allows you to actively contribute to discussions, share insights, and collaborate smoothly with the design team. It’s all about teamwork!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contextual Design</strong> : Understanding the context in which users will use your interface is crucial. Empathy mapping helps you grasp that context and design interfaces that feel like a natural extension of users’ lives. It’s like speaking their language and fitting right into their world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Iterative Design and Continuous Improvement</strong>: Empathy mapping is not a one-time thing. It’s an ongoing process of learning and improving. As a UI developer, you can keep refining your designs based on user feedback and observations, making your UI a shining star in the ever-evolving world of UX.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, my fellow UI developer, embrace empathy mapping! It’s your secret weapon to creating user-centered UI designs that rock users’ socks off. Let empathy guide your way, and you’ll be a UI hero in no time.</p>

<p>Now, let’s talk about empathy mapping itself and why it’s so awesome for UX designers and UI developers alike.</p>

<p>Empathy mapping is a technique used in the UX design process to gain a deeper understanding of users’ needs, emotions, and behaviors. It helps designers develop empathy for the users they are designing for, enabling them to create more user-centered and meaningful solutions.</p>

<p>I recently took Google’s UX design course and here’s the Google’s empathy mapping process. It involves four key components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Say: In this step, designers focus on capturing what the users say—both in direct quotes and paraphrased statements. This can be gathered through user interviews, surveys, or other forms of user research. The goal is to gather insights into users’ expressed needs, desires, pain points, and goals.</li>
  <li>Think: Here, designers try to uncover the thoughts and beliefs that drive users’ behaviors. This involves identifying users’ assumptions, expectations, mental models, and underlying motivations. Designers can infer these aspects by analyzing user feedback, observing their actions, and considering the context in which they use the product or service.</li>
  <li>Do: This step involves understanding the actions and behaviors users exhibit in relation to the product or service. Designers observe and document the specific tasks, interactions, and behaviors that users engage in while using the product. This helps identify pain points, areas of confusion, or usability issues that need to be addressed.</li>
  <li>Feel: The last component focuses on capturing the emotional aspect of users’ experiences. Designers seek to understand the range of emotions users may feel when interacting with the product or service. This can include positive emotions like joy and satisfaction, as well as negative emotions like frustration or confusion. Understanding the emotional landscape of users helps designers create more emotionally engaging and enjoyable experiences.</li>
</ol>

<p>By creating an empathy map, designers can synthesize and visualize the gathered information, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and insights about the users. This understanding then informs the design decisions, helps prioritize features and improvements, and guides the overall user-centered design process. UI developers that understand the empathy mapping process can contribute to creating user-centered interfaces that meet users’ needs, enhance usability, and deliver a positive user experience. It helps bridge the gap between design and development, ensuring that the final product aligns with users’ expectations and goals.</p>]]></content><author><name>Patt Sookmark</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know what’s cool?

Node.js is a popular platform for building server-side applications using JavaScript. One of its key features is its module system, which allows developers to organize their code into reusable and maintainable pieces. In this blog post, we’ll explore what Node modules are, how they work, and the different types of modules.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-node-modules">Introduction to Node Modules</h2>

<p>Node modules are essentially JavaScript files that encapsulate a set of related functionality. Each module can expose functions, classes, objects, or variables that can be imported and used in other modules or scripts. This modularity makes it easier to organize, maintain, and scale Node.js applications.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-node-modules">Types of Node Modules</h3>

<p>There are two types of Node modules: core modules and user-defined modules.</p>

<p>Core modules are modules that are built into Node.js itself. These modules can be accessed without any additional installation or setup.</p>

<p>User-defined modules, on the other hand, are modules created by developers for their specific use case. These modules can be shared and reused across multiple projects. User-defined modules can be downloaded and installed using the Node Package Manager (NPM).</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-node-module">Creating a Node Module</h3>

<p>To create a Node module, you need to follow a few steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new JavaScript file with the code you want to encapsulate.</li>
  <li>Export the functions, classes, objects, or variables you want to make available to other modules.</li>
  <li>Import the module in another JavaScript file using the ‘require’ function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an example of how to create a simple Node module:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// sampleModule.js
const add = (a, b) =&gt; {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = {
  add: add
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the code above, we define a function ‘add’ and export it using the ‘module.exports’ object. This allows us to import the module and use the ‘add’ function in another JavaScript file:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// index.js
const sampleModule = require('./sampleModule');

console.log(sampleModule.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this code, we import the ‘sampleModule’ and use the ‘add’ function to add two numbers.</p>

<h3 id="commonjs-modules">CommonJS Modules</h3>

<p>In CommonJS modules, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require</code> function is used to import modules, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exports</code> object is used to define what is exported from a module. When you need to access functionality from other modules, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require</code> comes to the rescue, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exports</code> lets you share your own code with the world.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of CommonJS modules:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// math.js
exports.add = (a, b) =&gt; a + b;

// index.js
const math = require('./math');
console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> function is exported from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">math</code> module using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exports</code> object. Then, in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> file, we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require</code> to import the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">math</code> module and access the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> function.</p>

<h3 id="es-modules">ES Modules</h3>

<p>ES modules offer a modern approach to module management. Discover the power of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code>statements in Node.js, and learn how they surpass the capabilities of CommonJS modules. We’ll delve into the nuances of default exports and named exports, and discuss the interplay between ES modules and CommonJS modules. Unleash the full potential of ES modules and take your code organization to the next level.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of ES modules:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// math.js
export const add = (a, b) =&gt; a + b;

// index.js
import { add } from './math';
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> function is exported using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code> statement, and then it’s imported using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import</code> statement in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> file</p>

<p>🎉 🎉 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄🎉 🎉
Congratulations on mastering the art of Node modules! Armed with a deep understanding of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exports</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import</code>, you possess the tools to transform your codebase into a well-structured, maintainable masterpiece. Embrace the magic of Node modules in your projects, and experience the joy of clean, efficient coding.</p>

<p>Remember, your coding journey is an adventure, and Node modules are your trusty companions. May your modules always be organized, your bugs scarce, and your coding endeavors filled with endless creativity and success. Happy coding!</p>]]></content><author><name>Patt Sookmark</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Node.js is a popular platform for building server-side applications using JavaScript.

<h2 id="start-the-project-by-using-nextjs">Start the project by using Next.JS</h2>

<p>Next.js is a popular React framework that makes it easy for developers to build server-side rendered web applications. In this blog, I’ll discuss how I use Next.JS in my word game application.</p>

<h2 id="why-nextjs">Why Next.js?</h2>

<p>One of the main reasons why I’m using Next.js for this project is to learn about server-side components. With server-side rendering, the performance of the word game is improved by pre-rendering pages that speeds up the load time from the server and sending them to the client.</p>

<h2 id="creating-routes-with-nextjs">Creating Routes with Next.js</h2>

<p>Next.js has a directory-based routing system that makes it easy to create and manage routes. I can create a new page by creating a new file in the “pages” directory. For example, if I want to create a “home” page, I can create a file called “index.js” in the “pages” directory. Similarly, to create a “contact” page, I can create a file called “contact.js” in the “pages” directory.</p>

<h2 id="adding-images-in-nextjs">Adding Images in Next.js</h2>

<p>Next.js uses the “next/image” component to optimize images for performance. This component automatically resizes and optimizes images based on the device size and screen resolution.
To use the “next/image” component, I need to provide an image URL and configure its properties. The image URL can be either an absolute URL or a relative path to the image file in our project.
Next.js also provides a configuration object that can be uses to customize the image properties. I can configure properties such as the image size, quality, and layout.</p>

<h2 id="creating-sample-audio-files">Creating Sample Audio Files</h2>

<p>For this project, I create a couple sample audio files using QuickTime and GarageBand. I can create a new audio file in GarageBand, make some edits, and export it as an MP3 or M4A file. MP3 is a more widely used format, but M4A is a higher quality format that is compatible with Apple devices.</p>

<h2 id="handling-audio-files-in-nextjs">Handling Audio Files in Next.js</h2>

<p>To add an audio file to our web app, my choices are either the HTML audio tag or the JavaScript audio constructor. The HTML audio tag is easier to use, but the JavaScript audio constructor gives me more control over the audio playback. Because I will be rendering and referencing multiples audio file on the same page, I decided to use constructor over html tag.
<br />
<br />
I have now completed Phase I of the project and will be moving on to Phase II, which involves the creation of the server and database. Please stay tuned for more updates.</p>

<p>I recently worked on a small project that involved consuming GitHub’s GraphQL API to display specific users’ public repositories. This project was a great opportunity for me to learn about GraphQL and how it differs from REST API. In this reflection blog, I will share my experience of using GraphQL API and the challenges I faced during the project.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges I faced while learning to use GitHub’s GraphQL explorer was understanding how the data was structured. It was a little overwhelming at first, but I overcame this challenge by watching a few YouTube videos and reading through other developers’ GitHub repositories. Once I got the hang of it, I found GraphQL to be quite powerful.</p>

<p>For those who may not be familiar, REST is a popular architectural style used in designing and developing web services. It involves the use of HTTP protocol for communication and works on the principle of stateless communication. The resources are accessed using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and the response from the server is usually sent in JSON, XML, or HTML format.</p>

<p>On the other hand, GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook that allows clients to request only the required data. Unlike REST, which returns all the data present in the resource, GraphQL has a strongly-typed schema that defines the data structure of the API. Clients can request data by specifying the required fields in the query.</p>

<p>The main differences between GraphQL and REST APIs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data fetching: GraphQL allows the client to fetch only the required data, while REST returns all the data present in the resource.</li>
  <li>Schema: GraphQL has a strongly-typed schema that defines the data structure of the API, while REST has no schema.</li>
  <li>HTTP requests: REST APIs use different HTTP methods to access resources, while GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all requests.</li>
  <li>Response format: REST APIs usually return data in JSON, XML, or HTML format, while GraphQL always returns data in JSON format.</li>
  <li>Caching: REST APIs have better caching support due to the use of HTTP caching mechanisms, while GraphQL does not have native support for caching.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, both GraphQL and REST have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the project. My experience of using GitHub’s GraphQL API was quite positive, and it was interesting to see the data available from GitHub. Overall, this project helped me broaden my knowledge and experience of working with different APIs, which will certainly come in handy in my future development projects.</p>

<h2 id="the-teams-first-full-stack-application-journey">The team’s first full-stack application journey</h2>

<p>My FE team was tasked with creating a simple full-stack application. We decided to use Postgres, Express, React, and Node (PERN stack)</p>

<h2 id="why-we-choose-pern-stack">Why we choose PERN Stack</h2>

<p>It is because our knowledge of Javascript would cover three out of four technologies in the stack. The combination of these technologies allowed us to build a full-stack web application with CRUD operations.</p>

<p>PERN is an acronym for Postgres, Express, React, and Node.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Postgres - It is an object-relational database management system that uses the SQL language. We chose Postgres because our team members have some exposure to the relational database and also Postgres was easy to pick up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Express - It is a back-end framework for Node.js used for building web applications, and especially APIs. We decided to go with Express because it is a javascript framework, the documentation looked fairly straightforward, and because of the support, we have within Turing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>React - A Front end Framework taught at Turing. One of the requirements for the project is to use react framework. Couples of benefits are Virtual DOM in React makes the user experience better and developers work faster. React allows its components to be reused which saves time and effort.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Node.js - A Javascript runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-we-go-about-setting-up-a-workflow">How we go about setting up a workflow</h3>

<p>We approach our workflow from the FE perspective where we consider the user story first to design how our data table is going to be. First, we wrote the MVP UI, and create the server using Express. Then, we connect the express server to Postgres. Once the two frameworks re connected, we seed our mock data to the database, and voila. Time to deploy!</p>

<h3 id="what-else-we-added-to-our-pern-stack-to-make-it-work">What else we added to our PERN stack to make it work</h3>

<p>We used Knex to create the schema and write queries for Postgres. We used Docker Compose for local development with the database and Table Plus for interacting with the data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Opt for a library than writing code from scratch</strong></p>

    <p>In our UI, we wanted to have a robust filter function that can filter multiple keywords and also has interactive features. As this function evolved, the code got messier and buggier to a point that we decided to use a filter library instead. Our reasoning was, we wanted to get to the core of the project, which was building a backend. Using a library not only saved us time but also created a more stable feature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Changing MVP decision</strong></p>

    <p>As the deadline approached, we had to trim down our MVP to the most basic feature value and forgo some of the design elements we set up at the beginning to be able to deliver a usable product.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asking for help</strong></p>

    <p>We were having difficulty with different versions of Postgres and the Knex documentation that was provided to us. With the help of a Mod4 student, we were introduced to backend tools: Docker Compose and TablePlus. These tools make working with Postgres easier and make a change to data much more simple.</p>

<p>I was introduced to MVC pattern during the beginning of Turing, a 7-months online, computer programming course, while the focus was to write everything only in vanilla JavaScript. MVC is an acronym for Model View Controller where, Model represents the business logic or what makes the application, View is what user interact with and Controller is the bridge between the Model and View.</p>

<p>In addition to MVC pattern, I also employed Repository pattern for managing data within Model.A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection. In my case, I use a class instance to construct a data object and repository to store a compilation of data.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-use-mvc-in-my-project">How I use MVC in my project</h2>

<p>I used the MVC pattern while building a trip-booking application called Travel Tracker. I found that because the Model returns the data, it allows the same component to be reused. This concept makes the code modular, which means the modification of a function doesn’t affect the entire model, since the model doesn’t depend on the views. The approach also limits the amount of code duplication since the View is separated from the data and business logic.</p>

<p>On top of the MVC pattern, I also employed the Repository pattern for managing data within the Model. A repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection. In my case, I use a class instance to construct a data object and repository to store a compilation of data. Using the repository pattern separates data access from business logic. Some of the benefits are centralization of the data access logic makes code easier to maintain. This approach allows business and data access logic to be tested separately, help reduce duplication of code, and lowers the chance of making programming errors.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-and-success">Challenges and Success</h2>

<p>Before being introduced to the MVC, my DOM elements doesn’t separate from my data model functions. With a prior frame of thought, I had to refactor many of the codes to fit with the MVC pattern. For example, I wrote a function in the controller file using DOM elements. What I should have done is write a function in the View file to call a controller function that returns value to manipulate DOM elements.
Another challenge is to be comfortable with having many small files. Having a small amount of code in many files created a clear structure that makes it easier to navigate. This also minimized the chance of accidentally changing other codes unintentionally.
My win for this implementation is I have a better sense of focusing on the purpose of the function and concept of single responsibility.</p>]]></content><author><name>Patt Sookmark</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding MVC]]></summary></entry></feed>
