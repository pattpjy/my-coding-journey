### FitLit

We created a fitness tracking application using vanilla javascript. We used a local server and incorporated fetch request to GET and POST data. Error handling was added to both fetch GET and POST requests to catch errors that may occur from either request. Features added allows users to see all data displayed in a visually pleasing manner using charts from chart.js. We utilized dayjs to format and standardize dates. We utilized recursion to construct a weeks worth of data if there are gaps in the data's date. We added a helper function file to house functions that are use multiple times throughout the project to keep our code DRY.
