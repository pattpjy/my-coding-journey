As a front-end developer venturing into the world of backend development, I understand the challenges of setting up a new server every time you want to test a new idea. That's why I'm excited to share my solution: Express TypeScript Boilerplate, a game-changing template that simplifies the process of building Express servers using TypeScript.

🔧 Key Features:

- Express server with TypeScript
- Local SQLite database
- Knex query builder for development environment
- CORS middleware for seamless cross-origin requests

2️⃣ Install dependencies: `npm install`
3️⃣ Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4️⃣ Access the server at: `http://localhost:3001`
